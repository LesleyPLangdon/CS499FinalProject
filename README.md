## CS499 Capstone Project

I have worked with a single project to show various skills.  The project started as four separate data structure applications coded in C++.

[First](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5D2aWQO3dp0Wt-4xXw-qx2CH7z1lMjI/view?usp=sharing), I conducted a code review to establish what the process would entail.  I looked not just at the modifications I would make to the code itself but also at things like formatting and comments.  

[Second](https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/CS499FinalProjectMilestone2.git), I combined the four separate applications into one.  The main objective here was to identify reusable code that could be shared between the applications.

[Third](https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/CS499FinalProject.git), I modified the different data structures to accommodate searching by different fields.  This was an exercise to highlight how different searches work and the benefits and limitations of each.  It is meant to be an educational solution, not a practical one.

[Finally](https://github.com/LesleyPLangdon/CS499eBidDatabase.git), I took the csv file data set that was used in this application and fed it into a MySQL database.  I then used queries to execute the same searches that were featured in the prior application.  To demonstrate this work, I have linked to a repository that contains a text description of the steps I took as well as several screenshots of my work.
